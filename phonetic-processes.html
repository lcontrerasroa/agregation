<p>Hierarchical structure of syllables (σ). Key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Onset</strong> (first consonant or consonant
cluster)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nucleus</strong> (vowel)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coda</strong> (last consonant or consonant
cluster)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Phone<strong><u>mic</u></strong> transcriptions, also known as broad
transcriptions and written between slashes //, are used to represent
words using phonemes, the minimal speech units that convey sense and
meaning in a language.</p>
<p>Phone<strong><u>tic</u></strong> transcriptions, also known as narrow
transcriptions and written between square brackets [ ], can be used to
represent more specific phenomena that tend to appear in connected
speech, i.e. “real” language use, and which do not tend to result in
changes in meaning. These representations are made via different symbols
or diacritics proposed by the International phonetic alphabet. Here are
some of the most common connected speech phonetic processes:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="linking-sandhi-liaison"><strong>Linking /
sandhi / liaison</strong></h2>
<p>In connected speech, whenever a word ends in a consonant and the
following word starts with a vowel (i.e. C#V), the final consonant of
the first word (i.e. its “coda”) tends to be articulated as the first
consonant of the first syllable of the following vowel (i.e. its
“onset”). This is rarely transcribed, especially in phonemic
transcriptions //, but can be represented with the linking IPA symbol ‿
in phonetic transcriptions. For example:</p>
<p>I sat on the chair [aɪ ˈsæt‿ɒn ðə ˈtʃeə] ~ sounds like [ˈsæ
tɒn]<br />
I have a good friend [aɪ ˈhæv‿ə ˈgʊd ˈfrend] ~ sounds like [ˈhæ və]</p>
<p>This is particularly important in SSBE where /r/ is usually not
pronounced in coda position, but is pronounced (i.e. it surfaces) in a
C#V context:</p>
<p>💡 As a convention, linking-r is transcribed in both
phone<strong><u>mic</u></strong> // and phone<strong><u>tic</u></strong>
[ ] transcriptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my car / maɪ ˈkɑː / 🡪 my car is parked [maɪ ˈkɑːr‿ɪz pɑːkt]<br />
here / hɪə / 🡪 here are my reports [ˈhɪər‿ɑː maɪ rɪˈpɔːts ]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A third type of linking sometimes occurs in a V#V context when the
first V is a diphthong ending in /ɪ/ (/aɪ, eɪ, ɔɪ/) or /ʊ/ (/aʊ, əʊ/),
or the vowels /iː/ or /uː/. In these cases, their closest corresponding
approximant surfaces at the onset of the first syllable of the following
word:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="compression"><strong>Compression</strong></h2>
<p>Compression is a phonological process whereby two syllables, or
sometimes two phonemes, become one. Two important cases of compression
happen in spoken English:</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="syllabic-consonants-through-schwa-deletion">Syllabic consonants
(through schwa deletion)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>nation, vision /ˈneɪʃn̩ ˈvɪʒn̩/<br />
prism, chasm /ˈprizm̩ ˈkæzm̩/<br />
simple, uncle /ˈsɪmpl̩ ˈʌŋkl̩/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these cases, the sonorant, takes up the place of the syllable
nucleus. This can be represented using the syllabic diacritic under the
consonant [ ̩ ]. Furthermore, when the alveolar lateral approximant [l]
becomes syllabic, it is also usually velarized (i.e. the back of the
tongue approaches the velum). This “dark l”, which can also be found in
coda position, can be represented with the symbol [ɫ].</p>
<p>simple, uncle [ˈsɪmpɫ̩ ˈʌŋkɫ̩]</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="triphthong-smoothing">Triphthong
smoothing</h3>
<p>In SSBE, the triphthongs / aʊə, aɪə, eɪə / tend to lose their median
vocalic component and are “smoothed” towards the diphthongs [aə, eə].
Sometimes this can go even a step further and be pronounced as a long
monophthong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hour /ˈaʊə/ 🡪 [ˈaə] 🡪 [aː ~ ɑː]<br />
fire /ˈfaɪə / 🡪 [ˈfaə] 🡪 [aː ~ ɑː]<br />
player /ˈeɪə/ 🡪 [ˈpleə]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="aspiration"><strong>Aspiration</strong></h2>
<p>Voiceless plosives /p, t, k/ in syllable-initial position (=in onset
position) are usually aspirated [ʰ] in stressed syllables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pin /ˈpɪn/ 🡪 [ˈpʰɪn] apart /əˈpɑːt/ 🡪 [əˈpʰɑːt]<br />
type /ˈtaɪp/ 🡪 [ˈtʰaɪp] attend /əˈtend/ 🡪 [əˈtʰend]<br />
car /ˈkɑː/ 🡪 [ˈkʰɑː] occur /əˈkɜː/ 🡪 [əˈkʰɜː]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aspiration does not happen when /p, t, k/ are preceded by /s/<br />
spin /ˈspɪn/ 🡪 [ˈspɪn] a sport / ə ˈspɔːt/ 🡪 [ə ˈspɔːt]<br />
scar /ˈskɑː/ 🡪 [ˈskɑː] a step / ə ˈstep/ 🡪 [ə ˈstep]</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="no-audible-release"><strong>No audible
release</strong></h2>
<p>At the end of words in C#C contexts or in C# contexts before pauses,
plosives<br />
/p, t, k, b, d, g/ tend to be articulated without their final release
phase (the final “explosion” of the plosive which releases air). This is
represented with the diacritic [ ̚ ] on top of the consonant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw her at the concert 🡪 [aɪ ˈsɔː hər ət̚ ðə ˈkɒnsət̚ ]<br />
“I’m tired,” he said. 🡪 [aɪm ˈtaɪəd̚ hi ˈsed̚ ]<br />
bag 🡪 [ˈbæg̚ ] speak 🡪 [ˈspiːk̚ ] etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="nasalization"><strong>Nasalization</strong></h2>
<p>Vowels tend to become nasalized [ ̃] before or between nasal
consonants /m, n, ŋ/ (i.e. in a VN or NVN context).</p>
<p>man 🡪 [ˈmæ̃n] morning 🡪 [mɔ̃ːnɪ̃ŋ] monkey 🡪[ mʌ̃ŋki]</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="assimilation"><strong>Assimilation</strong></h2>
<p>Assimilation is a phonetic process whereby the <u>distinctive
features</u> of one sound (<strong>place</strong> of articulation,
<strong>manner</strong> of articulation, <strong>voicing</strong>) are
transferred to a contiguous sound. Nasalization is one particular case
of assimilation. Two other main cases are traditionally identified in
English. These are cases of <strong>regressive assimilation</strong>,
i.e. a sound A shares its features of a sound B in the following manner:
B 🡨 A.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="assimilation-of-place">Assimilation of
place</h3>
<p>Alveolar consonants / t, d, n, s, z / are particularly affected by
the place of articulation of the consonant that follows. Thus:</p>
<p><strong><u>[ t, d, n ]</u></strong>:</p>
<p>[t] becomes [p] (bilabialized) before [p, b, m] (bilabial
consonants), and<br />
[k] (velarized) before [k, g ] (velar consonants)</p>
<p>💡 Some phonologists prefer using the “no audible release” diacritic
on the assimilated phoneme because, when assimilated, these plosives
tend to remain unreleased.</p>
<p>🡪 That man [ˈðæp̚ ˈmæn]<br />
Great Britain [ˌgreɪp̚ ˈbrɪtən]<br />
🡪 That car [ˈðæk̚ ˈkɑː]</p>
<p>Pete Griffin [ˌpiːk̚ ˈgrɪfɪn]</p>
<p>[d] becomes [b] (bilabialized) before [p, b, m] (bilabial consonants)
and<br />
[g] (velarized) before [k, g] (velar consonants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🡪 a bad person [ə ˌbæb̚ ˈpɜːsən]</p>
<p>a mad guy [ə ˌmæg̚ ˈgaɪ]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[n] becomes [m] before [p, b, m],</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[ŋ] before [k, g]</p>
<p>[ɱ] before [f, v]</p>
<p>🡪 a fine man [ə ˌfaɪm ˈmæn]</p>
<p>a fine garage [ə ˌfaɪŋ ˈgærɪdʒ]</p>
<p>in fact [ɪɱ ˈfækt], symphony [ˈsɪɱf əni]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>[s, z]</u></strong></p>
<p>[s] becomes [ʃ] (palatalized) before [ʃ] (a post-alveolar /
pre-palatal consonant)</p>
<p>🡪 this shoe [ˈðɪʃ ˈʃuː]</p>
<p>[z] becomes [ʒ] (palatalized) before [ʃ]</p>
<p>🡪 these shoes [ˈðiːʒ ˈʃuːz]</p>
<p><strong><u>A note on palatalization</u></strong></p>
<p>Palatalization can happen word-internally as well. Most of these
cases of<br />
palatalization have become lexicalized (i.e. are now part of the
phonemic<br />
form of the word). As a rule of thumb, the palatalized phoneme can
be<br />
traced back to the French form of the word:</p>
<p>💡 These palatalization changes have become part of the
phone<strong><u>mic</u></strong> // form of the word.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="assimilation-of-manner">Assimilation of
manner</h3>
<p>Rare in English.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="assimilation-of-voicing">Assimilation of
voicing</h3>
<p>Final voiced consonants tend to get <strong>devoiced</strong> [ ̥ ]
or <strong>voiceless</strong> before an initial voiceless consonant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🡪 a big person [ə ˈbɪg̥ ˈpɜːsən] or [ə ˈbɪk ˈpɜːsən]<br />
have to [ˈhæv̥ tə] or [ˈhæf tə]<br />
of course [əv̥ ˈkɔːs] or [əf ˈkɔːs]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="elision"><strong>Elision</strong></h2>
<p>In spontaneous connected speech, some clusters of
<strong><u>obstruent consonants</u></strong> within or across words tend
to get simplified for articulation’s sake. In clusters of 3 or 4
consonants, median consonants are prone to deletion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked him 🡪 / aɪ ˈɑːs<u>k</u>t ɪm/ 🡪 [aɪ ˈɑːst ɪm]<br />
Next class 🡪 ˈneks<u>t</u> ˈklɑːs 🡪 [ˈneks ˈklɑːs]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some words have integrated elisions into their standard phonological
pronunciation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>must /ˈmʌst/🡪 mustn’t /ˈmʌsnt/<br />
listen /ˈlɪsn/<br />
grandmother /ˈɡrænˌmʌðə/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>💡 This is how these words are represented in both
phonem<strong><u>ic</u></strong> and phonet<strong><u>ic</u></strong>
transcriptions.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="epenthesis"><strong>Epenthesis</strong></h2>
<p>As opposed to elision, epenthesis is a phonetic process whereby a
sound is inserted. In English, there is often an <strong><u>epenthetic
post-nasal plosive</u></strong> (=an extra plosive after a nasal sound),
especially in transitions from nasal sounds to plosives or fricatives.
The inserted plosive is <strong><u>homorganic</u></strong> with the
nasal sound (=they share the same place of articulation).</p>
<p>The most common cases are from /n/ to /s/ (alveolar to alveolar
[n<strong><u>t</u></strong>s]), from /m/ to /t/ (bilabial to alveolar
[m<strong><u>p</u></strong>t]), from /m/ to /s/ (bilabial to alveolar
[m<strong><u>p</u></strong>s]). This happens because a small explosion
tends to happen naturally during the transition between these
sounds:</p>
<p>🡪 chance /ˈtʃɑːns/ 🡪 [ˈtʃɑːn<u>t</u>s] or <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XZ8CVgzq-Q">[ˈtʃænts] in
GA</a><br />
🡪 I’m stuck! /aɪm ˈstʌk/ 🡪 [aɪm<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCIlLWeQXI0">p</a>ˈstʌk]<br />
🡪 historically, <em>empty</em> is the result of epenthesis (added [p]):
comes from Old English <em>œmtig</em>. (Laure Gardelle, 2013)</p>
