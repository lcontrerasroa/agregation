<h1>4. Three Coming</h1>
<span class="chapter">Excerpt from <i>White Teeth</i> by Zadie Smith (pp. 67-69)</span>

<div id="content">
<div class="scene">
    Archie was at work when he heard the news. Clara was two and a half months up the spout.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"You're not, love!"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"I am!"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"You're not!"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"I am! And I arks de doctor what it will look like, half black an' half white an' all dat bizness. And 'im say anyting could happen. Dere's even a chance it may be blue-eyed! Kyan you imagine dat?"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Archie couldn't imagine that. He couldn't imagine any piece of him slugging it out in the gene pool with a piece of Clara and winning. But what a possibility! What a thing that would be! He dashed out of the office on to the Euston Road for a box of cigars. Twenty minutes later he swaggered back into <span class="italic">MorganHero</span> with a huge box of Indian sweets and started making his way round the room.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Noel, have a sticky thing. That one's good."</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Noel, the office junior, looked inside the oily box with suspicion. <span class="character">"What's all this in aid...?"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Archie pounded him on the back. <span class="character">"Going to have a kid, ain't I? Blue eyes, would you credit it? I'm celebrating! Thing is, you can get fourteen types of dal, but you can't get a bloody cigar in the Euston Road for love nor money. Go on, Noel. How about this one?"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Archie held up a half-white, half-pink one with an unwelcoming odour.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Erm, Mr Jones, that's very... But it's not really my cup of..."</span> Noel made as if to return to his filing. <span class="character">"I'd better get on with..."</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Oh, go on, Noel. I'm going to have a kid. Forty-seven and I'm going to have a little baby. That calls for a bit of a party, don't it? Go on... you won't know till you try. Just give it a nibble."</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Just them Pakistani foods aren't always... I've got a bit of a funny..."</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Noel patted his stomach and looked desperate. Despite being in the direct mail business, Noel hated to be spoken to directly. He liked being the intermediary at <span class="italic">MorganHero</span>. He liked putting calls through, telling one person what another person said, forwarding letters.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Bloody hell, Noel... it's just a sweet. I'm just trying to celebrate, mate. Don't you hippies eat sweets or something?"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Noel's hair was ever so slightly longer than everyone else's, and he had once bought an incense stick to burn in the coffee room. It was a small office, there was little to talk about, so these two things made Noel second only to Janis Joplin, just as Archie was the white Jesse Owens because he came thirteenth in the Olympics twenty-seven years ago, Gary from Accounts had a French grandmother and blew cigarette smoke out of his nose so he was Maurice Chevalier, and Elmott, Archie's fellow paper-folde...
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Noel looked pained. <span class="character">"Archie... Did you get my note from Mr Hero about the folds on the...?"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Archie sighed. <span class="character">"On the Mothercare account. Yes, Noel, I've told Elmott to move the perforation."</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Noel looked thankful. <span class="character">"Well, congratulations about the... I'll be getting on with..."</span> Noel returned to his desk.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Archie left to try Maureen the receptionist. Maureen had good legs for a woman her age – legs like sausages tightly packed in their skins – and she'd always fancied him a bit.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Maureen, love. I'm going to be a father!"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Are you, love? Oh, I am pleased. Girl or -"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Too early to tell as yet. Blue eyes, though!"</span> said Archie, for whom these eyes had passed from rare genetic possibility to solid fact. <span class="character">"Would you credit it!"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Did you say blue eyes, Archie, love?"</span> said Maureen, speaking slowly so she might find a way to phrase it. <span class="character">"I'm not bein' funny but isn't your wife, well, coloured?"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Archie shook his head wonderingly. <span class="character">"I know! Her and me have a child, the genes mix up, and blue eyes! Miracle of nature!"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Oh yes, miracle,"</span> said Maureen tersely, thinking that was a polite word for what it was.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Have a sweet?"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Maureen looked dubious. She patted her pitted pink thighs encased in their white tights. <span class="character">"Oh, Archie, love, I shouldn't. Goes straight on the legs and hips, don't it? An' neither of us is getting any younger, are we, eh? Are we, eh? None of us can turn back the clock, can we, eh? That Joan Rivers, I wish I knew how she does it!"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Maureen laughed for a long time, her trademark laugh at <span class="italic">MorganHero</span>: shrill and loud, but with her mouth only slightly open, for Maureen had a morbid dread of laughter lines.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    She poked one of the sweets with a sceptical, blood-red fingernail. <span class="character">"Indian, are they?"</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Yes, Maureen,"</span> said Archie with a blokeish grin, <span class="character">"spicy and sweet at the same time. Bit like you."</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Oh, Archie, you are funny,"</span> said Maureen sadly, for she had always fancied Archie a bit but never more than a bit because of this strange way he had about him, always talking to Pakistanis and Caribbeans like he didn't even notice and now he'd gone and married one and hadn't even thought it worth mentioning what colour she was until the office dinner when she turned up black as anything and Maureen almost choked on her prawn cocktail.
</div>

<div class="scene">
    Maureen stretched over her desk to attend to a ringing telephone. <span class="character">"I don't think I will, Archie, love..."</span>
</div>

<div class="scene">
    <span class="character">"Please yourself. Don't know what you're missing, though."</span>
</div>
</div>
