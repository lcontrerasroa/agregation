<h1 id="suprasegmentals"><u>Suprasegmentals</u></h1>
<p>Intonation or <em>suprasegmental</em> or <em>prosodic</em> analysis
covers phonological phenomena beyond segments (i.e. consonants and
vowels). It studies three main dimensions: <strong>tone-unit
segmentations</strong>, <strong>accent</strong> and
<strong>intonation</strong>. It follows a completely different system of
analysis from that of segmental phonetics and phonology. It is based on
what is called the “British school of intonation”, which is rooted in
three main principles:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-three-ts-tonality-tonicity-tone">The
three Ts: tonality, tonicity, tone</h2>
<p><strong>Tonality</strong> is the segmentation of speech into <u>tone
units</u> (also known as intonation units), the basic unit of analysis
in the British school of intonation. Although tone units often coincide
with clauses and punctuation, that is not always the case. Some basic
rules (see below) can help identify where to delimitate tone units.</p>
<p><strong>Tonicity</strong> is the identification of the <u>nucleus</u>
of the tone-unit, i.e. its most prominent accented syllable. Be careful:
accent ≠ stress. Although they often coincide, stress is lexical (at a
word level, as in <em>at’tack, ‘sentence, kanga’roo</em>), whereas
accent is suprasegmental (at a tone unit level).</p>
<p><strong>Tone</strong> is the intonational movement that takes place
throughout (and after) the articulation of the nucleus. Tones are
associated to basic meanings in English.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tonality-tone-unit-segmentation">Tonality
(tone-unit segmentation)</h3>
<p>Tone units are utterances produced in one breath, normally preceded
and followed by silence, and usually corresponding to syntactic
structures – <u>clauses</u>, mainly. Therefore, tone-unit breaks usually
coincide with punctuation marks (full stops, exclamation marks,
questions marks, commas…). There are, however, a few exceptions to these
correspondences.</p>
<p>Tone units have an underlying structure made up of four parts:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-head</strong>: All of the unaccented syllables before the
first stressed syllable in the tone unit, (also called the
anacrusis).</p>
<p><strong>Head</strong>: Starts with the first accent and includes all
the syllables up until the nucleus.</p>
<p><strong>Nucleus</strong>: The most prominent accented <u>syllable</u>
of the tone unit, to which a tone is associated. It is usually (but not
always!) the <u>last lexical item</u> (LLI) – the last “content word”.
“Function” or grammatical words (prepositions, auxiliaries, articles,
etc.) after the LLI are normally unaccented and part of the tail.</p>
<p><strong>Tail</strong>: All of the unstressed syllables after the
nucleus.</p>

<p>Visual representation of the tone-unit’s underlying structure (as per
the <em>tonetic interlinear</em> model)</p>
<p>Out of all of these parts, the only obligatory one is the nucleus.
That means that there can be a tone unit made up of just one (nuclear)
syllable:</p>
<p><img src="images/media/image6.jpeg"
style="width:5.325in;height:2.10833in" /></p>
<p>For the <em>Agrégation</em>, you will only need to delimitate the
external boundaries of the tone unit, but it is always useful to be
aware of how it is internally articulated. To delimitate them, use
single vertical bars (|) to represent short pauses (commas) and double
vertical bars for long ones (||) (full stop, exclamation or question
mark, change of speaker…). Do not use punctuation in your tone-unit
delimitation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I don’t think he cares. 🡪 | Honestly | I don’t think he
cares ||<br />
He’s the only person I’ve ever trusted. Just him.<br />
🡪 | He’s the only person I’ve ever trusted || Just him ||</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="cases-of-punctuation-without-tone-unit-break"><strong><u>Cases of
punctuation without tone-unit break</u></strong></h4>
<p>Two main cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Final vocatives</u>: vocatives (i.e. words using to refer to
someone when talking to them) tend to be part of the tail of the tone
unit when they come at the end:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But I don’t want to go, dad! 🡪 | But I don’t want to go dad ||<br />
What are you doing, Mary? 🡪 | What are you doing Mary ||</p>
<p>If we move the vocative to the beginning of the sentence, however,
the comma that follows it does mark a tone-unit break:</p>
<p>But dad, I don’t want to go! 🡪 | But dad | I don’t want to go
||<br />
Mary, what are you doing? 🡪 | Mary | what are you doing? ||</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><u>Final reporting clauses</u>: final reporting clauses also tend
to be part of the tail at the end of tone units.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have no idea”, he said 🡪 | I have no idea he said ||<br />
That’s impossible, I’m afraid 🡪 | That’s impossible I’m afraid ||<br />
That’s all it takes, I suppose 🡪 | That’s all it takes I suppose ||</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="tone-unit-break-but-no-punctuation"><strong><u>Tone-unit break but
no punctuation</u></strong></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Cases of coordination</u> (clauses or phrases coordinated by
<em>and, or, but</em>…). The coordinating conjunction becomes the
pre-head of the following tone unit.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>He knocked on the door but no-one came 🡪 | He knocked on the door |
but no-one came ||<br />
A car drove by and stopped at the traffic light<br />
🡪 | A car drove by | and stopped at the traffic light ||<br />
Do you want apples or grapefruit? 🡪 | Do you want apples | or grapefruit
||</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><u>After a defining relative clause</u> (as opposed to a
non-defining relative clause):</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My aunt who has one eye is eighty years old 🡪 | My aunt who has one
eye | is eighty years old ||<br />
The book which I read yesterday was boring 🡪 | The book which I read
yesterday | was boring ||</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: Non-defining relative clauses have breaks before
and after. Here, breaks coincide with punctuation:</p>
<p>My aunt, who has one eye, is eighty years old<br />
🡪 | My aunt | who has one eye | is eighty years old ||<br />
The book which I read yesterday was boring<br />
🡪 | The book | which I read yesterday | was boring ||</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="tone-unit-breaks-within-clauses"><strong><u>Tone-unit breaks within
clauses</u></strong></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Long subject</u>: There is a tone unit break – a short pause
to catch your breath! – (without a comma) after a long grammatical
subject:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The bicycle that my aunt bought me for Christmas was completely
destroyed in the accident 🡪<br />
| The bicycle that my aunt bought me for Christmas | was completely
destroyed in the accident ||</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><u>Initial sentence adverbial</u>: Adverbs that affect the whole
clause, usually followed by a comma, tend to have their own tone
unit.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

🡪 | Hopefully | we will never have to see him again ||</p>
<p>In fact, most people don’t even floss.<br />
🡪 | In fact | most people don’t even floss ||</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><u>Topicalized object</u>: Whenever the canonical SVO order
(subject-verb-object) is altered to OSV, the object tends to be uttered
in its own tone unit. A comma tends to be added in these cases as
well.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

🡪 | I think | unless I got it wrong | that he’s Brazilian ||</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="tag-questions"><strong><u>Tag
questions</u></strong></h4>
<p>Tag questions tend to have their own tone-unit, especially
<strong><u>reverse-polarity tags</u></strong> (“checking tags”): tags
that are negative when the main verb is positive, or vice-versa.</p>
<p><em>Positive-negative</em></p>
<p>We could do it tomorrow, couldn’t we?<br />
🡪| We could do it tomorrow | couldn’t we ||</p>
<p>They’ve got their books, haven’t they?<br />
🡪 | They’ve got their books | haven’t they ||</p>
<p><em>Negative-positive</em></p>
<p>It’s not finished, is it?<br />
🡪 | It’s not finished | is it ||<br />
It wasn’t a disaster, was it?<br />
🡪 | It wasn’t a disaster | was it ||</p>
<p><u><strong>Constant polarity</strong></u> tags (positive-positive)
tend to pertain to the same tone unit as the rest of the clause:</p>
<p>You’re ready to go, are you?<br />
🡪 | You’re ready to go are you ||<br />
Close the window, would you please?<br />
🡪 | Close the window would you please ||</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tonicity-nucleus-placement">Tonicity (nucleus
placement)</h3>
<p>The nucleus is the most prominent <strong><u>accented
syllable</u></strong> (and not THE WHOLE WORD) of a tone-unit.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="broad-focus"><u>Broad focus</u></h4>
<p>In most “neutral utterances” (unmarked contexts), most stressed words
are also accented and the distinction does not seem to matter. In these
cases, the nucleus tends to fall on the LLI.</p>
<p>The nucleus is informationally important: it signals <strong><u>new
or important information</u></strong>, which in canonic syntax tends to
come at the end of utterances in English. To signal the nucleus, we
underline it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>| I’m going to the <u>ci</u>nema ||<br />
| Do you like <u>cook</u>ies ||<br />
| I’d like to speak to the <u>man</u>ager ||<br />
All content words here contain new information<br />
🡪 nucleus on the stressed syllable of the LLI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These neutral cases are said to be in / carry <strong><u>broad
focus</u></strong>: everything is considered new information; therefore,
everything is in focus.</p>
<p><u>Exceptions</u></p>
<p>In a handful of cases, some lexical items in final position tend to
not carry the nucleus:</p>
<p><strong>Empty words</strong>:<br />
<em>things, people, places, the man, the woman, the guy…</em></p>
<p>| I keep <u>see</u>ing things || vs. | I keep hal<u>lu</u>cinating
||<br />
| What are you going to <u>tell</u> people || vs. | What are you going
to <u>say</u> ||<br />
| They’re really <u>go</u>ing places || vs. | They’re really
suc<u>cess</u>ful ||</p>
<p><strong>Common adverbs of time and place in final
position</strong></p>
<p>| They’re <u>com</u>ing tomorrow || | Who’s re<u>plac</u>ing her now
||</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="narrow-focus"><u>Narrow focus</u></h4>
<p>The nucleus can shift from the LLI when the LLI has already been
introduced into the context, either literally (in a sentence earlier) or
situationally (in the spatial/temporal context). In such cases, the
tone-unit is said to be in <strong><u>narrow focus</u>.</strong> Old
information is de-accented relegated to the tail of the tone-unit.</p>
<p>A: | We mustn’t forget to invite the <u>Wat</u>sons ||<br />
B: | But we <u>al</u>ways invite the Watsons ||<br />
A: | What’s wrong with inviting the Watsons ||<br />
B: | There’s nothing wrong with inviting the Watsons ||<br />
C: | How do you mean there’s nothing wrong with inviting the Watsons
||</p>
<p><strong>Pro-forms</strong></p>
<p>Pronouns or other words used to replace phrases, nouns, etc. :
<em>one, any, some, do, did, so…<br />
</em>(they usually refer to <strong>old information already
introduced</strong>)</p>
<p>| Where’s your <u>name</u>-tag || | I haven’t <u>got</u> one ||
(<em>one</em> replaces <em>name-tag</em>, old info)<br />
| Do you have any <u>sug</u>ar || | I don’t <u>have</u> any ||
(<em>any</em> acts as a pronoun for <em>sugar</em>)<br />
I If you’re not o<u>kay</u> with it | just <u>say</u> so || (<em>so</em>
replaces a whole clause)<br />
| Mary got more candy than <u>Kim</u>berly did || (<em>did</em> replaces
a whole clause)</p>
<p><strong>Broad vs. Narrow focus</strong></p>
<p>| Any news from <u>home</u> ||<br />
| Our daughter moved to <u>Chin</u>a ||<br />
All content words contain new information<br />
= the whole IP is in focus 🡪 broad focus</p>
<p>| Where did your daughter move to? ||<br />
| Our daughter moved to <u>Chin</u>a. ||<br />
Only <em>China</em> contains new information, even though it coincides
with the LLI.<br />
= only part of the IP is in focus 🡪 narrow focus</p>
<p>| Who moved to China? ||<br />
| Our <u>daught</u>er moved to China. ||<br />
Only <em>daughter</em> contains new information<br />
= only part of the IP is in focus 🡪 narrow focus</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="contrastive-focus">Contrastive focus</h4>
<p>Contrastive focus is a special case of focus through which the
speaker draws attention to a contrast they are making:</p>
<p>| You may have <u>start</u>ed your essay | but have you
<u>fin</u>ished your essay ||</p>
<p>Any word can bear contrastive focus, including function words, if it
is being contrasted (explicitly or indirectly) with another element:</p>
<p>| I thought he was <u>mar</u>ried | (neutral)<br />
| I thought he <u>was</u> married | (he no longer is)<br />
| I thought <u>he</u> was married| (him, not her)<br />
| I <u>thought</u> he was married| (even if you said he wasn’t)<br />
| <u>I</u> thought he was married | (not somebody else)</p>

style="width:6.3in;height:2.10879in" /></p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tone">Tone</h3>
<p>The nucleus is associated to a tonal movement. In English, there are
4 main tones (and an extra, les common fifth one), and they are
associated to enunciative meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fall</strong>: declarative modality, completeness,
finality, certainty, exclamation, neutrality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rise</strong>: interrogative modality, incompleteness,
non-finality, doubt, friendliness/kindness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fall-rise</strong>: usually associated to contrast,
contradiction, warnings. Also, an alternative to incompleteness like
rise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rise-fall</strong>: usually associated to surprise,
enthusiasm and/or sarcasm.</p></li>
<li><p>Level: non-finality, usually present in parentheticals.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="fall">Fall \</h4>
<p><u>Declarative sentences and responses to open questions:</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>| \<u>Yes</u> | \<u>sure</u>! ||<br />
| I’ll \<u>see</u> you tonight ||<br />
| Where do you <u>come</u> from? || | \<u>Lon</u>don. ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Wh- questions and second halves of alternative questions</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>| Where do you \<u>come</u> from? ||<br />
| Would you like /<u>tea</u> | or \<u>cof</u>fee? ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Imperatives</u> (orders, commands)</p>
<p>| Shut \<u>up</u> || And close the \<u>door</u> ||</p>
<p><u>Exclamations and greetings</u></p>
<p>| Good \<u>morn</u>ing Paul! | Congratu\<u>la</u>tions! ||</p>
<p><u>Question tags</u> (if the speaker is not really doubting)</p>
<p>| You are coming to the \party, | \<u>aren’t</u> you? ||</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="rise">Rise</h4>
<p><u>Yes-no questions</u> (esp. declarative questions, i.e. questions
with no morphosyntactic marks of interrogation like subject-verb
inversion or do-auxiliary)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>| Can you speak /<u>Man</u>darin? ||<br />
| He took his /<u>pass</u>port? ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Echo questions and pardon wh- questions</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>| I’ve just met \John || | /<u>John</u>? ||<br />
| I’ve just met \John || | /<u>Who</u> have you met? ||<br />
| /<u>What</u>? || /<u>Par</u>don? || /<u>Right</u>? || /<u>Real</u>ly?
|| /<u>Did</u> he? ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Lists</u> (except the last item)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>| I’ll buy some /<u>bread</u>, | /<u>flour</u>, | /<u>sal</u>ad, |
and \apples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Dependent clauses</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>| When we a/<u>rrived</u>, | there were people \everywhere. ||<br />
| I’d like to visit \Wales, | when I have some /<u>money</u>. ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Question tags</u> (if the speaker is really doubting)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>| You are coming to the \party, | /<u>aren’t</u> you? ||</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="fall-rise">Fall-rise \/</h4>
<p><u>Contrast</u> (but a fall is also possible)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>| I think they will sur\render || | They \/<u>won’t</u> surrender!
||</p>
<p>| Are you a vege/tarian? || | Well I \/<u>used</u> to be. ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Initial adverbials</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>| \/<u>For</u>tunately, | I was \wrong. ||</p>
<p>| In the \/<u>first</u> place, | I’ll go to \see him. ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Initial dependent clauses</u> (as an alternative to a rise)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>| When we a\/<u>rrived</u>, | there were people \everywhere. ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Implicational fall-rise</u></p>
<p>The fall-rise implies something further: a contrast between what is
expressed and what has not, or not yet, been expressed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>| Well I know her \/<u>face</u> | but I can’t remember her \name
||</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speaker has the choice of making the contrast explicit, as in the
second version, or leaving it implicit, as in the first. Whether
explicit or implicit, the implication is still hinted at by the
fall-rise intonation.</p>
<p>The unexpressed implication can usually be formulated in a clause
beginning with <em>but...</em>, which would make it explicit. The
implicational fall-rise can be thought of as the tone that signals a
<em>but...</em> to come.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="rise-fall">Rise-fall /\</h4>
<p>Used for highly marked contexts. 🡪 Very rare! Not to be confused with
the Fall-rise.</p>
<p><u>Surprise, excitement</u></p>
<p>| I passed the e/\xam! | | /\Ohhh, | /\ woooow!! ||</p>
<p><u>Challenging the listener</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="images/media/image8.png"
style="width:1.625in;height:1.01528in" />| You don’t think it’s
im/\portant, | /\do you? ||<br />
| Well you bloody /\ought to! ||</p>
