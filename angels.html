    <h1>Phonological Analysis Exercise</h1>
    <p>In this section, you will find a transcription of a scene from <i>Angels in America</i> by Tony Kushner. As you read through, pay attention to the character pronunciations and language used.</p>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Watch the video above to get a sense of the performance.</li>
        <li>Read through the transcription and follow along.</li>
        <li>Focus on the pronunciation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>SSBE vs. GA</h2>
    <p><strong>Look for words with pronunciations that differ in SSBE and GA varieties. Make phonological transcriptions (//) for both varieties and comment on their differences.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <h2> Phonetic processes in connected speech</h2>
    <p><strong>Find five examples of phonetic processes that you can both<i>identify and hear</i> in the speakers' pronunciation. Make phonetic transcriptions ([]) of the processes and explain them. Remember: phonetic processes in connected speech usually span beyond a single word. </strong></p>

    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Are you... Who are you?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> Who are you?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> What are you doing in my hallucination?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> I'm not in your hallucination. You’re in my dream.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> You’re wearing makeup.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> So are you.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> But you’re a man.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> <span class="action">(Feigning dismay, shock, he mimes slashing his throat with his lipstick and dies, fabulously tragic. Then:)</span> The hands and feet give it away.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> There must be some mistake here. I don’t recognize you. You’re not... Are you my... some sort of imaginary friend?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> No. Aren’t you too old to have imaginary friends?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> I have emotional problems. I took too many pills. Why are you wearing makeup?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> I was in the process of applying the face, trying to make myself feel better—I swiped the new fall colors at the Clinique counter at Macy’s. <span class="action">(Showing her)</span><br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> You stole these?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> I was out of cash; it was an emotional emergency!<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Joe will be so angry. I promised him. No more pills.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> These pills you keep alluding to?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Valium. I take Valium. Lots of Valium.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> And you’re dancing as fast as you can.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> I’m not <i>addicted</i>. I don’t believe in addiction, and I never... well, I <i>never</i> drink. And I <i>never</i> take drugs.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> Well, smell you, Nancy Drew.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Except Valium.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> Except Valium; in wee fistfuls.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> It’s terrible. Mormons are not supposed to be addicted to anything. I’m a Mormon.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> I’m a homosexual.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Oh! In my church we don’t believe in homosexuals.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> In my church we don’t believe in Mormons.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> What church do... oh! <span class="action">(She laughs)</span> I get it.<br><br>
    <span class="action">[Harper continues:]</span><br>
    I don’t understand this. If I didn’t ever see you before and I don’t think I did then I don’t think you should be here, in this hallucination, because in my experience the mind, which is where hallucinations come from, shouldn’t be able to make up anything that wasn’t there to start with, that didn’t enter it from experience, from the real world. Imagination can’t create anything new, can it? It only recycles bits and pieces from the world and reassembles them into visions... Am I making sense right now?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> Given the circumstances, yes.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> So when we think we’ve escaped the unbearable ordinariness and, well, untruthfulness of our lives, it’s really only the same old ordinariness and falseness rearranged into the appearance of novelty and truth. Nothing unknown is knowable. Don’t you think it’s depressing?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> The limitations of the imagination?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Yes.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> It’s something you learn after your second theme party: It’s All Been Done Before.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> The world. Finite. Terribly, terribly... Well... This is the most depressing hallucination I’ve ever had.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> Apologies. I do try to be amusing.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Oh, well, don’t apologize, you... I can’t expect someone who’s really sick to entertain me.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> How on earth did you know...<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Oh that happens. This is the very threshold of revelation sometimes. You can see things... how sick you are. Do you see anything about me?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> Yes.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> What?<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> You are amazingly unhappy.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Oh big deal. You meet a Valium addict and you figure out she’s unhappy. That doesn’t count. Of course I... Something else. Something surprising.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> Something surprising.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Harper:</span> Yes.<br><br>
    <span class="character">Prior:</span> Your husband’s a homo.<br><br>
