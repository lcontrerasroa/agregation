    <h1>Excerpt from <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> by Oscar Wilde</h1>
    <h2>Act II - Beginning</h2>
    <span class="action">[Garden at the Manor House. A flight of gray stone steps leads up to the house. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year, July. Basket chairs and a table covered with books are set under a large yew-tree.]</span><br><br>

    <span class="character">Miss Prism:</span> [Calling.] Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moulton's duty than yours? <span class="highlight-pink">Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you</span>. Your German grammar is on the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday's lesson.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Cecily:</span> [Coming over very slowly.] But I don’t like German. It isn’t at all a becoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after my German lesson.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Miss Prism:</span> Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve yourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he was leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, <span class="highlight-green">he always lays stress on your German when he is leaving for town</span>.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Cecily:</span> Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I think he cannot be quite well.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Miss Prism:</span> [Drawing herself up.] Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his gravity of demeanor is especially to be commended in one so comparatively young as he is. <span class="highlight-pink">I know no one who has a higher sense of duty and responsibility</span>.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Cecily:</span> I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are together.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Miss Prism:</span> Cecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his life. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his conversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that unfortunate young man, his brother.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Cecily:</span> I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother, to come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him, Miss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. <span class="highlight-green">You know German, and geology</span>, and things of that kind influence a man very much.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Miss Prism:</span> [Shaking her head.] I do not think that even I could produce any effect on a character that, according to his own brother’s admission, is irretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would desire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment’s notice. As a man sows so shall he reap. <span class="highlight-green">You must put away your diary, Cecily</span>. I really don’t see why you should keep a diary at all.<br><br>
    
    <span class="character">Cecily:</span> I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I didn’t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.
