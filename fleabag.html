    <h1>Excerpt from <i>Fleabag</i> by Phoebe Waller Bridge</h1>
INT. RESTAURANT — NIGHT
<span class="action">Later. Dad holds his glass mid-toast. Fleabag is now holding a tequila shot. Godmother, Martin, and Claire listen to Dad speak.<br><br>We reveal there’s also an UNFAMILIAR MAN at the table, also listening. He is dressed in a regular shirt and trousers, but we will later find out that this is <span class="character">PRIEST</span>.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
So, uh... It means a great deal to both of us that you... that we...
<span class="action">(gets a little emotional)</span>
Are all here together... for this very special family... gang bang...<br><br>
<span class="action">Fleabag looks, confused, at Priest.<br><br></span>
<span class="character">DAD</span>
Just... being here... I know we’ve had our... I just... The feeling that I have... is... right in... I just want to say I... Very much. And... That’s it.<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
<span class="action">(moved)</span>
Oh darling.<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Congratulations, Dad.<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
Congratulations!<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Thank you!<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
<span class="action">(raising a glass)</span>
May these be the worst of our days!<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Don’t know who this guy is.<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
Happy for you, old boy. Best decision a man can make.<br><br>
<span class="action">Martin and Claire smile smugly at each other.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Ugh.<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
<span class="action">(to Fleabag)</span>
You look well.<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
Thank you.<br><br>
<span class="action">Claire and Fleabag share a fleeting look.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Wine everyone?
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
Yes please! I’d love some wine.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
You’ll adore it, I chose it.<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Not for us, thanks.<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
Off the sauce.<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Six months and counting.<br><br>
<span class="action">Everyone falls silent. In shock.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
Why... would you do that?
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
We just enjoy each other more this way.
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
<span class="action">(looking at Claire)</span>
Just don’t want to miss a thing.
<br><br><span class="action">Claire flicks her eyes at Fleabag.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Haven’t seen her since—

<br><br>INT. RESTAURANT. A DIFFERENT AREA — NIGHT
<span class="action">Earlier in the evening. Fleabag and Claire have both just arrived. They have their coats over their arms before heading off to the table.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
<span class="action">(spiky)</span>
Nice jumpsuit.<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(spiky)</span>
Thank you.
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
<span class="action">(spiky)</span>
You look well, where have you been?
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
Boots. Lovely there this time of year.
<span class="action"><br><br>Claire is not amused.</span>

<br><br>INT. RESTAURANT — NIGHT
<span class="action">We return to Fleabag, Claire, Godmother, Dad, Martin, and Priest at the table.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Well, you look fantastic.<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
<span class="action">(to Dad and Godmother)</span>
You both look gorgeous.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
Thank you!
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Is that fur?
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
Yes, but it’s OK because it had a stroke.
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Oh, lovely.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
<span class="action">(joking to Priest)</span>
I can’t go to hell for that can I, Father?
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
No, no, as long as you confess—
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Oh God, he’s their priest.
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
—you’ve got nothing to fucking worry about.
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Their cool, sweary priest.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
Love the Catholics. You can get away with anything.
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
<span class="action">(laughing)</span>
A lot of them did.
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
<span class="action">(to Godmother)</span>
It’s an honour to be marrying you two. Thank you.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
But I didn’t realise you were allowed out without your little—
<span class="action"><br><br>She gestures to her neck, i.e., his dog collar.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
<span class="action">(joking)</span>
Oh no, have I disappointed you?
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
<span class="action">(disappointed)</span>
Of course not.
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Devastated.
<span class="action"><br><br>The Needy Waitress appears. She points at the champagne bottle.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">NEEDY WAITRESS</span>
Can I get you another bottle?
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Needy waitress.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
No, it’s alright, we’ve already ordered wine.
<br><br><span class="character">NEEDY WAITRESS</span>
<span class="action">(so gutted)</span>
Oh no. Really?
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(kindly)</span>
I’ll have another tequila.
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
I’ll have a tequila!
<span class="action"><br><br>Fleabag looks at him. He smiles.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">NEEDY WAITRESS</span>
Oh great! Thank you so much!
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
Can I have a sparkling water with a dash of lime, please?
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
I’ll have the same.
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
Dream team.
<span class="action"><br><br>They do a little high five at the table. Fleabag notices. Ugh.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
<span class="action">(about Priest)</span>
Now the most FASCINATING thing about Father here is that his mother was originally a lesbia—

<br><br>EXT. BACK OF RESTAURANT – NIGHT
<span class="action">Fleabag is leaning, head against a wall. One hand has a cigarette in it. She exhales deeply.</span>

<br><br>INT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT
<span class="action">Fleabag is back at the table with Claire, Godmother, Dad, Martin, and Priest. Their starter plates are being cleared away by the Needy Waitress.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
You do look tired.
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
It’s not as exhausting as I thought it would be, actually.
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
She’s commuting from Finland.
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
She’s got her packing down to a ten-minute turnaround.
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
<span class="action">(laughing)</span>
It’s fine.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
Fabulous!
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
It’s all about—
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Rolling it up rather than—
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
Folding it.
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Yes, I’ve read about that. Sure you don’t want wine?
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>/CLAIRE
No, thank you.<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
<span class="action">(sipping wine)</span>
It really is delicious. I admire you both so much.
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
It’s really turned us around hasn’t it, honey?
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
So much more energy. You know, in Finland they—
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
Is there a reason you’re not? Or is that...?
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
He’s an alcoholic.
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
Oh fun! My parents were alcoholics!
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Oh, great. Well, we found it’s easier if we do it together. I don’t really like the taste any—
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
And we’re trying for a baby.
<span class="action"><br><br>Beat. Claire and Fleabag look at each other.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
Oh Claire. We thought you couldn’t have them.
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
What? Why?
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
You just seem a little—
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
They say a lifestyle change can help so here we go!
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
That’s SO exciting darling! Good luck.
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
That’s wonderful!
<span class="action"><br><br>Everyone sort of smiles. Fleabag eyes Claire.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Something’s up.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
And now you have money for proper help! Ghastly without help, I imagine. Tell us about Finland!
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Well, it’s um—cold and beautiful and dark.
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(bemused)</span>
I think she might be happy.
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
It’s a lot of pressure, but I love it. I have an amazing new partner out there who’s really pushed the company forward with—
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
You know, I can’t remember the last time we went away!
<br><br><span class="character">MARTIN</span>
Weren’t you both in Japan recently?
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
<span class="action">(amazed)</span>
JAPAN?! Wow!
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
Oh yes! But that was just a little fortnight.
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
Don’t ask her—
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
Why were you in Japan?
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Well, she—
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
I was—oh sorry darling.
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
No, no you—
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
Oh, thank you. Well, they flew us out with the sexhibition.
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
It really made an impa—
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
<span class="action">(sweetly to Dad)</span>
Sorry darling, do you want to—no?
<span class="action">(to the table)</span>
You see, you think of the Japanese as very prudish people.
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Well, not to generali—
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
But really they have a deep interest in sex in their culture. It’s just hidden in the underbelly. It’s not allowed to the surface.
<br><br><span class="character">CLAIRE</span>
Fair enough.
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
They really appreciated—
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
The honesty of the sexhibition. Whereas of course the—
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Americans! Now they—
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
The Americans! Just took me in their stride. The Japanese were really quite moved by my work, weren’t they darling?
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Yes.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
It caused quite a cultural—
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Ripple.
<br><br><span class="character">GODMOTHER</span>
Wave.
<span class="action"><br><br>Beat.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
Wave.
<span class="action"><br><br>Beat.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
No one’s asked me a question in forty-five minutes.
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
<span class="action">(to Fleabag)</span>
So what do you do?
<span class="action"><br><br>Everyone stops and stares at Fleabag. She’s shocked. She looks at him.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
I run a café.
<br><br><span class="character">PRIEST</span>
Oh, cool!
<span class="action"><br><br>Beat.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">DAD</span>
It’s going well, is it?
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
Yes. It is. It really is.
<span class="action">(to camera)</span>
It actually is.
<span class="action"><br><br>They smile sympathetically, not believing her.</span>
<br><br><span class="character">FLEABAG</span>
It is.
<br><br><span class="character">NEEDY WAITRESS</span><br><br>Can I get anyone any ice?<br><br>
